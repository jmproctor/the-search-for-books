# The-Search-For-Books

This is a copy of my previous repo, I had messed up the initial repo on where it started and had set the repo 1 file back to far in the directory, copying my /projects/ file. I chose to remake the repo instead of trying to figure out how to fix it.

## Description
This app is a Google Books API search engine is built in MERN Stack. Users are able to sign up and login to their accounts to search for and save their favorite books.


## User Story
```
- AS AN avid reader
- I WANT to search for new books to read
- SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase
```

## Usage

- The application allows users to search books with keywords.
- Users are able to create an account when providing user name, email and password.
- Logged in users will are able to save their favorite books as well as delete them.
- Saved books are stored in their account, so next time they login, the books are still in their account to be viewed.
